# The-Amazing-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team. It generates an HTML webpage that displays information and summaries for each employee info input.

While building this project I became further comfortable in using Node.js and object-oriented programming. I also learned the importance of test-driven development and look forward to doing so for the productivity and development of future projects.

## Mock-Up

This following image shows a mock-up of a generated HTML, its appearance and functionality:
![HTML webpage of the Team Profile Generator titled "My Awesome Team" that features three boxes listing employees names, titles, and other key info.](./src/assets/images/mock-up-html.png)

A completed example of this mock-up with the input's are available under "src/index.template.html" which can be edited to change as the user wishes.
